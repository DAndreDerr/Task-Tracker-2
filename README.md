# Task-Tracker-2

Trials and Tribulations:
So during the creation of my task tracker app I went through a lot trying to meet the requirements. As you can see the name of the folder is Task Tracker 2, for the original I tried using node and using app.get,post,delete etc to change data in a json file that would then be displayed on my front end, but that was much easier said than done. I spent a lot of time trying to get that work and even came in this sunday desperate to get an answer but when it came down to the time I ended up cutting my loses with attempting to do it that way.

What I did:
So what I did instead was follow the same tutorial Osiel used which had me create the task tracker using just HTML/CSS/JavaScript this way mostly utilized event listeners that when activated created, gave class lists to , and appended different elements. Once i got a completed functional task tracker I then styled it to my own style and liking. Finally to get it to run on local host I created another js file that used node/express to take (app.use) the files of my task tracker and put them onto local host with the port of my choosing

Next Time:
Overall I would say this project did help me understand not only node but javascript better as a whole. I just wish next time I would have been able to complete it my original way. One thing I may suggest for future cohorts is having a refrence (not a task tracker) that shows node, Json/mongo, and the front end working together.
